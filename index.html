                        age. After high school i've started <b>Engineering in Computer Science</b> at
                        Università Roma Tre where i've learned basics knowledge about algorithms,
                        data structure and automatics. My bachelor thesis in mobile robotics navigation inspired me to
                        join the master course in <b>Artificial Intelligece and Robotics</b> at Università La Sapienza in Rome.
                        Here i've acquired relevant knowledge
                        about robot kinematics, motion control, computer vision and deep learning.

                            for the whole team. I've started following tutorials on Gazebo and ROS best pratictes online
                            and i've
                            manage to deliver a reliable simulation of our future robot.</p>

                        <p>
                            To deliver a prototype as fast as possible to the market we could not write a slam algorithm from
                            scratch much less a planning controller. For that reason my task
                            has been to scout SLAM suites on the opensource network in ROS. I've found several
                            interesting solutions for us, but at the end <a
                                href="https://introlab.github.io/rtabmap/">RTABMAP</a> demonstrated to be
                            the most accurate. Using this algorithm we manage to build accurate 3D maps of the
                            environment aswell as providing a good localization in medium-wide areas.</br>
                            Planner choice has been quite straight forward since <a
                                href="http://wiki.ros.org/teb_local_planner">TEB </a> is considered one of the best

                        <p>
                            I built from scratch a computer vision pipeline being able to compute the position of an

                            of this pipeline is the bounding box information provided by the our custom YOLO network and 
                            those bounding box information are used to compute the pixel coordinates
                            of the object in the frontal camera image. Then it comes a pointcloud filtering and
                            segmentation extracting the 3D location of the trash according to the robot center. The
                            final step is to command the planner to send the robot to that location.

                            For safety reason we had to build some controller checking that the planned trajectory
                            is safe and for such reason i've been ask to think about a solution. Since in the 
                            previous project i've worked a bit with pointclouds, my solution came quite easy: this controller
                            tryes to segment a ground plane of points from the pointcloud and send alarm once it cannot.

                        <h3>An approach to camera calibration in Industrial Robotics using HexSight</h3>
                        <p>
                            Quality inspection tasks require the camera to be calibrated. In the industrial robotics
                            context the process of camera calibrations is usually performed manually by a human
                            operator, so the goal of this thesis was to develop a automatic way to perform
                            the calibration using an ABB robot, a camera and a machine vision software (HexSight). The
                            results obtained with this process demonstrated that automatic camera calibration can
                            achieve sub-milimetric accuracy aswell. </p>

                            implemented in this project shows a potential distributed control of several vehicles one

                            platoon and it chooses the velocity the group has to maintain. The vehicles behind him
                            follow it keeping a custom safety distance each other. Tests performed successfully even in
                            presence of communication delays and suddenly
                            brakes of the leader.

                        <p> A convolutional neural network was trained here to classify positive and negative COVID
                            patients based on their X-Ray image analysis. For this project me and my collegues we have
                            chosen to use transfer learning to obtain a better
                            performance in classification. We've trained the last layers of a ResNet101 on a small
                            labeled dataset we've found in the web managing to obtain a 70% classification accuracy.
